# elastic-searching
## Taking a look at React JS
In this repository I'm learning a little bit of React JS.  
This exercise is going to be a search App. For this we are going to use the reactive-search library, connected to a local elastic search cluster(not configured in this repo) and also material-ui for the responsive grid.

### Used libraries:
* Reactive-search
* material-ui
